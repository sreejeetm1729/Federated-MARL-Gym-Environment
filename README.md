# Federated MARL-Gym-Environment/Multi-Environment
𝙼𝙰𝚁𝙻-𝙶𝚢𝚖 𝙴𝚗𝚟: We introduce a custom multi-agent reinforcement learning environment built with Gymnasium and Pygame, designed for evaluating federated RL (FRL) algorithms. The environment models a grid world where multiple agents—such as robots—navigate to accomplish spatially distributed tasks, like reaching delivery points.
