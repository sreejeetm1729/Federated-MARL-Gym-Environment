# MARL-Gym-Environment
𝙼𝙰𝚁𝙻-𝚀-𝙻𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚗𝚒𝚗𝚐: We introduce a custom multi-agent reinforcement learning environment built with Gymnasium and Pygame, designed for evaluating federated RL (FRL) algorithms. The environment models a grid world where multiple agents—such as robots—navigate to accomplish spatially distributed tasks, like reaching delivery points.
